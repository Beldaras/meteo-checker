# Meteo Checker

This part is just a frontend static project for a meteo checker.
At this time, you can search a city on the home page, who stored in the local storage of your browser.

I just started a backend project to register user and his favorites cities. Finally, the goal is to display all the favorites cities cards of a user on the homepage.
Backend repository : https://github.com/Beldaras/meteo-express

npm run dev to view the project

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
